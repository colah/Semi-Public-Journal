colah's Semi-Public Journal
===========================

I really like my thoughts and ideas being public. It makes it easier to share them with friends, is logistically simpler, and is easy. And I have an ideological preference for it.

A lot of the ideas here are half-baked and written without the usual care I take in writing. They're just jotted down and reined in brain storming, or to get emotions out.

I'm exposing a lot of myself, please treat me kindly.

If you chose to look at these notes, please assume good faith and good intention. Please give ambiguity the benefit of the doubt. Where you find fault, default to the kindest explanation.

While they might some day get refined into essays and published, the content here is rough personal notes which  make no effort to promote or advocate, are not intended as an argument in public discourse, and are one of the most personal things I can share... I think that leaves them deserving of a greater gentleness and respectfulness in criticism than if they were in a published persuasive essay.

Please don't make this more public than it is. Leave comments inline on github, or email me. Please don't link to or promote this.
